# What is Vue.js?
Vue is a progressive framework for building user interfaces.  
It is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. 
The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects.
It is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.
# Template Syntax
Vue.js uses an HTML-based template syntax that allows you to declaratively bind the rendered DOM to the underlying Vue instanceâ€™s data.
All Vue.js templates are valid HTML that can be parsed by spec-compliant browsers and HTML parsers.

Under the hood, Vue compiles the templates into Virtual DOM render functions. Combined with the reactivity system, Vue is able to intelligently figure out the minimal number of components to re-render and apply the minimal amount of DOM manipulations when the app state changes.
# Differences between Vue.js and React
React and Vue share many similarities. They both:
utilize a virtual DOM
provide reactive and composable view components
maintain focus in the core library, with concerns such as routing and global state management handled by companion libraries

# Vue's advantages:
Flexible options for templates or renderings
Simple syntax and project setup
Rendering is faster and smaller
